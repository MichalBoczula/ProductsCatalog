Feature: Public API error contract
  Framework failures and unhandled exceptions expose a stable, safe problem shape.

  Scenario Outline: Framework failures have the same JSON problem contract
    When I trigger the Products REF-06 error case "<Case>"
    Then the Products REF-06 response has status <Status> and code "<Code>"

    Examples:
      | Case      | Status | Code                   |
      | route     | 404    | route_not_found        |
      | method    | 405    | method_not_allowed     |
      | media     | 415    | unsupported_media_type |
      | json      | 400    | invalid_json           |
      | type      | 400    | invalid_json           |
      | null      | 400    | invalid_json           |
      | missing   | 400    | invalid_json           |
      | body      | 400    | invalid_request        |
      | binding   | 400    | invalid_request        |
